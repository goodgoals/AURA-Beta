# AURA-Beta
AURA Beta is an experimental cognitive engine designed to be accurate and fix many flaws with the world’s most preferred architecture, LLMs. Many of the flaws with LLMs are issues that come from core architecture design and cannot easily be fixed. AURA fixes these issues through a series of methods that can be viewed in the README.
