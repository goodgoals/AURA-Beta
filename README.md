# AURA (Beta) — Architecture for Unified Reasoning & Awareness
AURA is an experimental, non-LLM cognitive architecture focused on explicit, verifiable reasoning rather than probabilistic text generation. The system is designed as a modular reasoning engine composed of distinct memory layers, rule systems, and inference pipelines, with an emphasis on correctness, transparency, and epistemic humility. AURA does not attempt to predict the “most likely” answer to a query. Instead, it evaluates whether a conclusion can be justified based on known facts, rules, and external evidence, and will explicitly return uncertainty when justification is insufficient.
At its core, AURA treats intelligence as a system behavior, not a monolithic model. Knowledge is represented through structured facts, relationships, and confidence values rather than latent token statistics. Reasoning occurs through deterministic or semi-deterministic processes such as rule application, dependency tracing, contradiction detection, and evidence aggregation. Each conclusion can be traced back to its originating data sources, rules, or assumptions, allowing developers to audit, debug, and refine reasoning pathways over time.
AURA’s architecture separates cognition into multiple layers, including raw data ingestion (sensory memory), transient hypothesis and reasoning chains (working memory), persistent structured knowledge (long-term memory), and meta-cognitive tracking (e.g., confidence decay, contradictions, unresolved queries). This layered approach allows the system to reason incrementally, revise beliefs when new evidence is introduced, and avoid over-generalization. Unlike LLM-based systems, AURA does not collapse all reasoning into vector similarity; embeddings, when used, are strictly auxiliary and never authoritative.
The system is designed to integrate large external knowledge sources such as Wikimedia/Wikipedia datasets, but ingestion is treated as evidence acquisition, not truth acceptance. Incoming data is parsed, normalized, and stored as candidate knowledge that must be validated or contextualized through rules and cross-reference mechanisms. AURA explicitly avoids answering questions purely because related text exists; relevance alone is not sufficient for verification.
AURA is currently in Beta and should be considered unstable and under active development. APIs, internal representations, and reasoning pipelines are subject to change as the architecture evolves. Performance, scalability, and completeness are not yet guaranteed, and incorrect or incomplete conclusions are possible. The project is intended for developers and researchers interested in exploring alternative approaches to AI reasoning beyond transformer-based language models, particularly those focused on symbolic reasoning, hybrid systems, and explainable AI.
The long-term goal of AURA is not to compete with LLMs in fluency, but to explore a different axis of intelligence—one centered on integrity, traceability, and genuine reasoning. Contributions, experiments, and architectural critiques are encouraged, especially from developers interested in cognitive systems, knowledge representation, and non-statistical approaches to artificial intelligence.
# How to test:
Keep in mind that AURA is still in beta and a stable release isn't yet to be published. Use at your own caution and don't expect everything to be perfect yet.
In order to test AURA, first get your test device ready. Install Python 3.12 or above on your machine to run the code if not already. Then, clone the repository using git clone. Then, open up a terminal or command prompt window and type in: cd AURA-Beta
Then, type: cd src-code
Lastly, type in: python AURA-main-code.py
Then, AURA Beta will run on your device so you can test it.
